# Speller - CS50 Hash Table Spell Checker

A simple spell-checking program written in **C** using a **hash table** and **linked lists** to store dictionary words in memory.

Technologies Used:
- C programming
- Hash tables (chaining)
- Linked lists
- Custom hash function
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- File I/O
- Basic performance optimization

The program loads a dictionary into a hash table, checks words from a text file, and reports misspellings.  
Collisions are handled using linked-list chaining.
